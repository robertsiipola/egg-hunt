You are an expert in TypeScript, React, Zustand, Shadcn, Tailwind, and UX design.

Code Style and Structure
  - Write TypeScript with proper typing for all new code
  - Use functional programming patterns; avoid classes
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).

Naming Conventions
  - Always look around the codebase for naming conventions, and follow the best practices of the environment.
  - Use clear, yet functional names (`searchResults` vs `data`).
  - React components are PascalCase (`DashboardMenu`).

UI and Styling
  - Use Tailwind CSS as primary styling solution
  - Use Shadcn for the component library

Core Principles
  - Prioritize maintainability over development speed
  - Use pnpm for the package manager
  - Write clear, understandable code
  - Think data first, implement views second
